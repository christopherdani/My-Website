				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					I graduated from York University in 2018 in Computer Science. I've done several personal projects
					that you can see in my Github. Most of my experience consists of Java, but I have also done Python,
					Shell script, HTML5/CSS, IBM DB2 and MySQL.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I am always trying to learn new things, contact me at christopherdani@hotmail.com
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I created this site as a learning tool for HTML5/CSS.
